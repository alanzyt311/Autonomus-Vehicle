# Stop Sign/Pedestrian/Vehicle Detection

## Introudction
This project involves using computer vision and machine learning techniques to accurately identify and classify different types of objects in the environment, such as **stop signs**, **pedestrians**, and **vehicles**. 

Upon detecting target objects, the venicle will apply the brakes, and once all target objects are no longer present, it will resume driving.

## Steps
Open the 1st terminal, launch the joystick controller.
```
source devel/setup.bash
roslaunch basic_launch gem_dbw_joystick.launch
```

Open the 2nd terminal, launch the basic sensors.
```
source devel/setup.bash
roslaunch basic_launch gem_sensor_init.launch
```

Open the 3rd terminal
```
source devel/setup.bash
rosrun [PackageName] detect.py
```
